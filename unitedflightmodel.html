<h1> A Predictive Model for Airline no-shows </h1>
<h2>Situation: Airline cost structure  </h2>
<p> Airlines face huge overhead costs with relatively little marginal expense per additional passenger. They recoup this cost by maximizing 
  passenger uptake on all of their flights.
</p>

<h2>Problem: No-Shows on flights</h2>
<p> When passengers don't show up for their flight, the airline effectively loses nearly all of the revenue from that passenger's ticket. 
  They mitigate this issue by overbooking, ensuring that there are more passengers than the flight's capacity. However, overbooking too aggressively
  can have dire consequences, both logistically in the airport and for the reputation of the entire airline
</p>
<h2>Resolution: A Predictive model for no-shows on flights </h2>
<p> The following model uses data from a month of United flights from Chicago to D.C to predict the number of no-shows on a given flight.
  Explanatory variables include the size of the traveling party, the country from which the was made, how far in advance it was made,
  the connection status of the flight, whether it has assigned seats, the booking class, use of frequent flyer miles, 
  and the number of times the booking was modified. 
  To be useful, the model must be designed for use in advance of the flight date. Accordingly, the input data was restricted to observations
  with daystodep (days to departure) < 5
</p>
<h2>The Model </h2>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight" height=90% padding=6%><pre class="highlight">
    <code>
      model1 <- glm(noshow ~ numberinparty + as.factor(bookingcountry) 
      + daystodep + as.factor(dow) + upline + downline + assignedseat 
      + as.factor(bookingclass) + modifycount + as.factor(mileageplus), 
      data = subset(uniqueairlines, daystodep > 4), 
      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
    </code></pre>
   </div>
 </div>
<p> Prior to building this model, certain steps were taken </p>
<h3> Data Cleaning </h3>
<p> The raw data for booking class and country was extremely granular (with many categories having < 5 observations). 
      In order to avoid noise and inflated errors the data was bucketed into more meaningful categories. One such
      example is below:
</p>
  <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge" width=90%>
  <div class="highlight" height=90% padding=6%><pre class="highlight">
    <code>
uniqueairlines$bookingcountry <- as.factor(uniqueairlines$bookingcountry)

bucketedcountries <- list(
  NorthAmerica = c("US", "CA", "MX"),
  SouthAmerica = c("AR", "BR"),
  Africa = c("CM", "ET", "MW","NA", "ZA","ZW"),
  Asia = c("CN", "HK", "IL", "IN", "JP", "KR", "LB", "PH", "PK", "SA", 
  "TH"),
  Oceania = c("AU", "NZ"),
  Europe = c("AL", "AT", "BE", "CH", "CS", "CY", "DE", "DK", "FR", "GB", 
    "NL",
    "NO", "RO", "RS", "SE"),
  Unknown = c("")
)

for (i in 1:length(bucketedcountries)) {
  levels(uniqueairlines$bookingcountry)[levels
    (uniqueairlines$bookingcountry)
    %in%bucketedcountries[[i]]] <- names(bucketedcountries)[i]
}
    </code></pre>
   </div>
 </div>
    <h3>Coefficient Testing</h3>
    <p> Given that we are modeling only domestic flights using primarily data from American passengers, it is entirely possible that bookingcountry
      actually has no effect on tendency to show up for a flight. With this in mind, the Wald test is used to evaluate collective 
      significance of the bookingcountry dummy variables.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight" height=90% padding=6%>
      <pre class="highlight">
      <code>
        model2 <- glm(noshow ~ numberinparty +  daystodep + as.factor(dow) + upline + downline + assignedseat + 
        as.factor(bookingclass) + modifycount + as.factor(mileageplus), data = subset(uniqueairlines, daystodep > 4),
        family = binomial(link = "logit"))
        
        anova(model1, model2, test = "Chisq")

      </code>
      </pre>
     </div>
   /div>
   <p> The p-value for the Analysis of Variances here is .2173, which suggests that booking country does not have an effect 
     on tendency to show up for a flight from Chicago to DC on United Flights
