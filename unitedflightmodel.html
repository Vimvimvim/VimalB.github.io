<h1> A Predictive Model for Airline no-shows </h1>
<h2>Situation: Airline cost structure  </h2>
<p> Airlines face huge overhead costs with relatively little marginal expense per additional passenger. They recoup this cost by maximizing 
  passenger uptake on all of their flights.
</p>

<h2>Problem: No-Shows on flights</h2>
<p> When passengers don't show up for their flight, the airline effectively loses nearly all of the revenue from that passenger's ticket. 
  They mitigate this issue by overbooking, ensuring that there are more passengers than the flight's capacity. However, overbooking too aggressively
  can have dire consequences, both logistically in the airport and for the reputation of the entire airline
</p>
<h2>Resolution: A Predictive model for no-shows on flights </h2>
<p> The following model uses data from a month of United flights from Chicago to D.C to predict the number of no-shows on a given flight.
  Explanatory variables include the size of the traveling party, the country from which the was made, how far in advance it was made,
  the connection status of the flight, whether it has assigned seats, the booking class, use of frequent flyer miles, 
  and the number of times the booking was modified. 
</p>

      data = subset(uniqueairlines, daystodep > 4), 
      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
